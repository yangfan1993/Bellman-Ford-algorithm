# Bellman-Ford-algorithm

The project 3 for CSEE4119, to implement the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm.
There are three layers here, the fundamental distanceVec.jave, then the routeTable.java and highest is bfclient.java.
And there is another more specific readme.txt.
Can not handle the poison reverse situation.
